Hebrew Number Converter
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdotjdot/hebrew-webapp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jdotjdot/hebrew-webapp)

This is a webapp in Flask built on my Hebrew numeral conversion tool that I contributed to the [Sefaria][1] project.

I built it as a test project for both the tool itself as well as for some practice in responsive design.  It was built
pairing with [Robert Lord](https://github.com/lord).

Visit http://hebrew.jdotjdot.com to see it in action.
